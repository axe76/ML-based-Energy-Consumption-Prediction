# ML-based-Energy-Consumption-Prediction
The code is an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network that predicts energy consumption based on the usage over the past 60 days. 
The code uses a time series LSTM to predict the power after every 60 days of energy consumption. 
The required dataset can be found in PowerAep2.csv
